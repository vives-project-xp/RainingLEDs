<h1>What?</h1>
<p>The RainingLEDs project is a project that contains a cool and unique photo location. It's made for all ages, but more focussed on influencers and social media users. Our project consists of a box with mirror foil and 18 LEDstrips, creating an infinite rain illusion.
</p>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>The 18 LED-strips are controlled by an ESP32-C3 microcontroller. That sends signals to the strips to recreate a handful of patterns. At the side of the box the vistors can push on 2 different buttons which put the LEDs in 2 different modes.</p>
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Materials:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>10 meters of BTF-LIGHTING WS2814 12V LED-strips</li>
        <li>3 wooden mbf plates making a cube from 70 X 70 X 71.8 cm</li>
        <li>Mirror foil for each side</li>
        <li>ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 microcontroller</li>
        <li>2 buttons in a 3D printed box</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Software:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>coded in C++</li>
    </ul>

<figcaption>This is the first, very simply, prototype. The main goal was to see how big the box has to be and how many LEDs we need.</figcaption>
